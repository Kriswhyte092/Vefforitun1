Q1: What is the difference between the internet and the WWW?
	- The internet is a network of networks with corresponding protocols that enables information sharing. The WWW is an imaginary information space that 
	  basically "runs on" the internet.
	  This option accurately describes the relationship between the internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). The internet is the physical infrastructure, 
	  consisting of interconnected networks and hardware, while the WWW is a system of interlinked documents and resources accessed via the internet. The WWW relies on 
	  the internet to function, as it utilizes the internet's infrastructure for data transmission.
Q2: Which statements are correct regarding the TCP/IP protocol stack?
	- Host names are translated to IP addresses using the DNS protocol.
		- This is correct. The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to translate human-readable host names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses.
	- A request is routed to a target host through a number of intermediate hosts.
		- This is also correct. In the TCP/IP protocol stack, data is typically routed through multiple intermediate hosts (routers) to reach the final 
	          destination.
	- The IP protocol uses IP addresses to identify machines on the internet.
		-This is correct. The Internet Protocol (IP) uses IP addresses to uniquely identify devices on a network, including the internet.
Q3:Which statements are true regarding HTTP?
	- DELETE is a safe method.
	  -False. DELETE is not considered a safe method in HTTP. It is intended to request that a resource be removed or deleted, which implies a change in state.
x
	- PUT is an idempotent method.
	  -True. The PUT method is idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.
	  
	- Important information in HTTP requests is encrypted.
	  -False. By default, HTTP does not encrypt the data, so it is sent in clear text. If encryption is needed, HTTPS (HTTP Secure) should be used.

	- Both the request and response of an HTTP request have extra information, so-called headers.
	  -True. HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type, length, authentication, etc.

	- HTTP is stateful.
	  -False. HTTP is considered stateless. Each request from a client to a server is independent, and the server does not retain any information about the state 
	   of the client between requests.

	- HTTP is stateless.
	  -True. As mentioned earlier, HTTP is a stateless protocol. Each request is independent, and the server does not retain any information about the state of the 
	   client between requests.

	- Everything sent via HTTP is in clear text.
	   -True. By default, HTTP sends data in clear text, which means that the information is not encrypted. If encryption is required, HTTPS should be used.
Q4: Which statements are true regarding HTTP response codes?
	- Codes starting with 4 indicate client errors. (True)
	 HTTP status codes in the 4xx range indicate client errors, meaning that the client (e.g., the web browser or user agent) has made a request that the server 
	 cannot fulfill.

	- The 200 status code means a request was successful. (True)
	  The HTTP status code 200 indicates a successful request. It is the standard response for successful HTTP requests.

	- Codes starting with 5 indicate the server has done something wrong. (False)
	  Codes starting with 5 (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) indicate server errors. They suggest that the server failed to fulfill a valid request made by the 
	  client, and the problem is on the server side, not the client side. They do not indicate that the user has done something wrong.
Q5: Cookies are used to add stateful behaviour to web sites. What is true regarding cookies?
